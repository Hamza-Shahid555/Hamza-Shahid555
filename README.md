## 🧩 About Me

I am a **Data Science undergraduate** deeply engaged in **Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence**, with a strong interest in **research-oriented problem solving** and **real-world deployment**.

I don’t just train models —  
I **analyze failures**, **optimize architectures**, and **push performance beyond baselines**.

My current work focuses on:
- 🔬 Medical image segmentation (Kidney stones, tumors, CT-based datasets)
- 🧠 Deep learning architectures (U-Net, Attention U-Net, CNNs)
- ⚙️ End-to-end ML pipelines (from raw data → evaluation → results)

## 🧠 My Approach to AI

✔️ Understand the **data first**  
✔️ Question every metric  
✔️ Optimize for **real-world performance**, not just accuracy  
✔️ Prefer **explainability & reproducibility** over shortcuts  

> *A model that performs well but cannot be explained is incomplete.*
