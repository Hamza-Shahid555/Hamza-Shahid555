### 🧩 **About Me**

> *"Data is the fuel, but architecture is the engine."*

I am a **Data Science Undergraduate** and **AI Engineer** focused on building production-ready intelligent systems. I move beyond simple model training to specialize in **architectural optimization**, **error analysis**, and deploying **scalable end-to-end machine learning pipelines**.

I combine strong mathematical foundations with practical engineering to solve real-world problems in **Medical Imaging**, **Predictive Analytics**, and **Autonomous Agents**.
